# Release notes

## 0.7.0 — Product v1 (2026-07-11)

Product v1 is the 0.7.0 lockstep release; it is a product milestone, not an npm
major-version claim.

### Highlights

- A new agent remains config-first: scaffold one folder, then continue in the
  local configuration conversation with the bundled `mono-agent-configure` and
  `mono-agent-memory` skills.
- `MemoryRecall` is enabled by default. Lite, Journal, and BuJo now have strict
  tiers, bounded/background work, metadata-only health, measurable graph recall,
  and side-by-side rebuild/rollback generations with integrity-qualified immutable
  snapshots.
- Supermemory is an external plugin (`@mono-agent/memory-supermemory`) rather
  than bundled core behavior.
- Active conversation history wins over durable memory for questions about the
  immediately preceding message.
- App-owned Slack, Telegram, file/button, and blocking `AskUser` tools work under
  enforced managed-SRT network policies without serializing proxy credentials or
  widening destination allowlists.

### Compatibility

- The minimum supported Node.js version is now **22.19.0** (previously Node.js 20). This aligns every published package with the Pi runtime already shipped in the `@mono-agent/agent-app` dependency graph. Upgrade Node before installing or updating mono-agent; Node 20 is no longer supported.

### Upgrade

Follow the [product-v1 cutover checklist](./docs/memory/validation-and-cli.md#enable-v1-on-an-existing-agent), including the built-in-memory versus Supermemory branch.
